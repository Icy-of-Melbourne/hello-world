One should learn the basics when using a platform, no?

Icy-of-Melbourne is apparantly from Melbourne, Australia. Certainly there are other places with that name (and even people, including a certain british politician who they're mostly named for), though unless you live near those places, the capital of Victoria is likely what comes to mind.

So beware if you find a REALLY cheap flight from Europe to 'Melbourne'! Since Melbourne International Airport, Florida is a thing! (Ours is in Tullamarine, to add to the confusion.)
